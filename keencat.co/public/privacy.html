    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p>
      Last Updated: October 15, 2019
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://sleepycatty.com">sleepycatty.com</a> we consider the
      privacy of our visitors, and the security of their personal information,
      to be extremely important. This privacy policy document describes, in
      detail, the types of personal information we collect and record at
      <a href="https://sleepycatty.com">sleepycatty.com</a>, and how we use this
      information.
    </p>
    <h3>LOG FILES</h3>
    <p>
      Like many other Web sites,
      <a href="https://sleepycatty.com">sleepycatty.com</a> makes use of log
      files. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard
      procedure for hosting companies, and a part of hosting services’s
      analytics. The information inside the log files includes: internet
      protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP),
      date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and in some cases, the number of
      clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site,
      track a user’s movement around the site, and to gather demographic
      information. IP addresses, and other such information, are not linked to
      any information that is personally identifiable.
    </p>
    <h3>COLLECTING INFORMATION</h3>
    <h4>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</h4>
    <p>
      What we collect depends largely on the interaction that takes place
      between you and SleepyCatty, most of which can be categorized under the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Using SleepyCatty Software as a Service.</strong> When you use any
      SleepyCatty Software as a Service, we store all the content you provide,
      including but not limited to accounts created for team members, files,
      pictures, project information, and any other information that you provide
      to the services you use.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any SleepyCatty Software as a Service, we also collect data about
      usage of the software. This may include, but is not limited to, numbers of
      users, flows, broadcasts etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Types of Personal Information:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) Users: identification, publicly available social media profile
      information, e-mail, IT information (IP addresses, usage data, cookies
      data, browser data); financial information (credit card details, account
      details, payment information).
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) Subscribers: identification and publicly available social media
      profile information (name, date of birth, gender, geographic location),
      chat history, navigational data (including chatbot usage information),
      application integration data, and other electronic data submitted, stored,
      sent, or received by end users and other personal information, the extent
      of which is determined and controlled by the Customer in its sole
      discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Purchasing SleepyCatty PRO subscription.</strong> When you sign up
      for SleepyCatty Software as a Service PRO Subscription, we collect
      information to process your payment and create your customer account. This
      information includes name, email address, physical address, telephone
      number, and company name where applicable. We retain the last four digits
      of your credit card to allow you to identify the card used for future
      purchases. We use a third-party service provider to process your credit
      card transactions. These third parties are governed by their own
      agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>User generated content.</strong> Our products and services often
      give you the option to provide feedback, such as suggestions, compliments
      or problems encountered. We invite you to provide such feedback as well as
      to participate with comments on our blog and community page. If you choose
      to post a comment, your user name, city, and any other information that
      you choose to post will be visible to the public. We are not responsible
      for the privacy of any information that you choose to post to our website,
      including in our blogs, or for the accuracy of any information contained
      in those postings. Any information that you disclose becomes public
      information. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a
      manner that may violate this privacy policy, the law or your personal
      privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data collected for and by our users.</strong> As you use our
      services, you may import into our system personal information you have
      collected from your subscribers or other individuals. We have no direct
      relationship with your subscribers or any person other than you, and for
      that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate
      permission for us to collect and process information about those
      individuals. As part of our services, we may use and incorporate into
      features information you have provided, we have collected from you, or we
      have collected about subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a subscriber and no longer want to be contacted by one of our
      users, please unsubscribe directly from that user’s bot or contact the
      user directly to update or delete your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Information automatically collected.</strong> Our servers may
      automatically record certain information about how you use our site (we
      refer to this information as “Log Data“), including both clients and

      Internet Protocol (IP) address, device and browser type, operating system,
      the pages or features of our site to which a user browsed and the time
      spent on those pages or features, the frequency with which the site is
      used by a user, search terms, the links on our site that a user clicked on
      or used, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the
      service and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this
      information to improve and enhance the service by expanding its features
      and functionality and tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sensitive personal information.</strong> Subject to the following
      paragraph, we ask that you not send or disclose to us any sensitive
      personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related
      to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs,
      health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or
      union membership) on or through the service or otherwise.

      If you send or disclose any sensitive personal information to us (such as
      when you submit user generated content to the site), you must consent to
      our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in
      accordance with this privacy policy. If you do not consent to our
      processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not
      provide it. You may use your data protection rights to object to or
      restrict processing of this sensitive personal information, or to delete
      such information, as detailed below under the heading “Your Data
      Protection Rights &amp; Choices.”

      enable our members to use the services to communicate with their
      subscribers. This also includes, for example, aggregating information from
      your use of the services or visit to our websites and sharing this

      steps to protect your information by requiring these third parties to
      enter into a contract with us that requires them to use the personal
      information we transfer to them in a manner that is consistent with this
      privacy policy.

      event that we confirm that we have collected personal information from
      someone under the age of 16 without verification of parental consent, we
      will delete that information promptly. If you are a parent or legal
      guardian of a child under 16 and believe that we might have any
      information from or about such child, please contact us.

      If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
      requirement or to enter into a contract with you, we will make this clear
      at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal
      information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences
      if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect
      and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate business
      interests, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those
      legitimate business interests are.
